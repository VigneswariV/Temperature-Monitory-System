DESCRIPTION : As part of my internship, I developed a temperature monitoring system using an Arduino UNO and a DHT11 sensor. The sensor reads the ambient temperature, and the data is displayed in real-time on the Arduino IDEâ€™s serial monitor. This project helped me understand how to interface sensors with microcontrollers, process sensor data, and implement real-time monitoring. It also improved my practical skills in embedded systems and coding using the Arduino platform.
