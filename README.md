# Temperature-Monitory-System
As part of my internship project, I developed a basic Temperature Monitoring System using an Arduino UNO and a DHT11 temperature sensor. The objective was to continuously read the surrounding temperature and display it in real-time using the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE.

The system works by collecting temperature data from the DHT11 sensor and sending it to the microcontroller. The Arduino then processes the data and outputs the temperature value through the serial monitor. This project helped me understand the interfacing of sensors, basic data acquisition, and real-time monitoring.

Tools and Components Used:

Arduino UNO

DHT11 Temperature Sensor

Jumper Wires

USB Cable

Arduino IDE
